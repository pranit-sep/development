This will be my first git use. I have added new files ( a lot ) to the folder/project ( git local repository).

I went through online tutorials and forums and see i can do

git commit -a
So I go to the base folder of the repository and do a

sudo git commit -a
But then, some screens comes up and asks me to add a comment which i do. i do not know how to proceed or exit. I do not want to mess up so i did ctrl + Z and did not do anything.

Can you guys please outline the commands I need to use?

git commit -a
